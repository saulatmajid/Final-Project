Student Progress Tracking System
================================

Student Progress Tracking System is a tool that would put student progress reports at teachers’ fingertips. This information always comes in handy to hold spur of the moment parent-teacher conferences.

1. Personas
===========

Maria Jones, 

A young educationalist

Details:
--------
A young educationalist, who is a full time teacher at a local private school. She is always well-prepared for regular PTMs. Interestingly, the school allows parents to swing by and meet with the teacher to discuss their child’s progress. These meetings pose a problem to Maria, and she is required to rush to the student record room and grab students’ files. With this tool, it will be easier for her to retrieve relevant information really fast.

Goals:
-----
To obtain student records in a very short span of time, in order to hold a successful parent-teacher conference.

2. Problem Scenarios
====================

Maria is expected to be equipped with updated information as she holds the meeting with the parents. Unfortunately, the record room is in the basement. She teaches 5 classes and it’s practically impossible to remember the records of students from all her classes, therefore she needs to consult student records.

Current Alternatives:
---------------------
An alternative is to ask the school to make students’ records available on teacher PCs, but this would require some software that would be integrated and would run through the entire school system. It would take some time and finances to implement.

Value Proposition:
------------------
As a cost effective make shift arrangement, use the Progress Tracking System that simplifies the whole procedure of retrieving relevant students’ records. 

3. User Stories
===============

User Story 01:
--------------
As Maria, I want to use Progress Tracking System, so that I can retrieve students’ individual records of either one specific course of a student or all courses s/he is enrolled in. This system will get me ready for my parent-teacher conferences.

User Story 02:
--------------
Student Progress Tracking System would also enable me to obtain the academic performance records of the whole class. If I need to track the whole classes' performance on a specific subject or on all subjects, or even tabulate class averages, this system will be of use to me. This would prepare me better for my parent-teacher conferences.
